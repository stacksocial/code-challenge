# Twitter API Challenge

## Goals

This challenge is designed to test your skills with:

* Ruby on Rails (5+)
* Object-Oriented Design
* Consuming RESTful APIs
* Source Control Systems

**Note: This challenge generally takes candidates no more than 2-3 hours to complete.**

## Requirements

1. Setup a public GitHub repository to host the code.
1. Create a Rails 5.0+ application

### Bonus Points

* Writing specs/tests!
* Use of React or GraphQL.
* Graceful error handling and working within Twitter API rate limits.
* Caching identical API calls for ~5 mins.
* Parsing `@mentions` in tweets and linking to the status pages for those.
* Anything else cool that you can think of! Dazzle us.

## Submission Guidelines

1. Create a `README` file within the repository that contains the following:
  1. Brief walkthrough of app design / choices made
  1. Local environment setup instructions
  1. Test suite setup/execution instructions (if applicable)
1. Email links to your **public GitHub** repo and **live Heroku** application to [dev-challenge@stackcommerce.com](mailto:dev-challenge@stackcommerce.com)
